# D-Lab Excel Fundamentals Workshop
This repository contains the materials for the D-Lab Excel Fundamentals workshop. 

## Prerequisites
No prior experience is assumed.

Check out D-Lab’s [Workshop Catalog](https://dlab-berkeley.github.io/dlab-workshops/) to browse all workshops, see what’s running now, and review prerequisites.

## Workshop Goals
In this workshop we introduce the fundamentals of spreadsheet data analysis in Microsoft Excel (with supporting materials for Google Sheets). We will introduce the Excel interface and tabs, then demonstrate how Excel functions work. Then, a combination of slides and to-it-yourself exercises will cover basic functions for dealing with text, math, logic, dates, and errors. Finally, we cover data visualization and analysis using charts and pivot tables.

## Installation Instructions
We will use Microsoft Excel to go through the workshop materials, which requires installation of Microsoft Excel (recommended) or the use of Google Sheets. Google Sheets (if Excel is not available to the attendee) is a web application that requires a steady internet connection during use but no download. Google products are usually not available in China, among other locations.
